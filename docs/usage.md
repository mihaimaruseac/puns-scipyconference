# How to use scipyconference

The `scipyconference` package is your go-to tool for generating clever, science-savvy puns perfect for the SciPy conference community. Whether you need a quick one-liner or an infinite stream of celebration, this package has you covered.

## Installation

```bash
pip install scipyconference
```

## Quick start

The magic happens with just three lines of code:

```python
import numpy as np
import scipyconference as conf
conf.create_puns(np.inf)
```

This is the famous **t-shirt example** - it creates an infinite celebration with party emojis! Perfect for when you want to show your enthusiasm for the conference.

## Basic usage

### Generate a specific number of puns

```python
import scipyconference as conf

# Generate 3 puns
conf.create_puns(3)
```

### Generate puns with a custom prompt

```python
import scipyconference as conf

# Generate 2 puns about pandas
conf.create_puns(2, prompt="pandas dataframes")

# Generate 1 pun about machine learning
conf.create_puns(1, prompt="scikit-learn optimization")
```

### The special infinite case

```python
import numpy as np
import scipyconference as conf

# The t-shirt example - creates a party celebration!
conf.create_puns(np.inf)
```

When you pass `np.inf` as the number, instead of generating infinite puns, the package creates a delightful party celebration with random emoji patterns. It's like having a digital confetti cannon for your terminal!

## Configuration

You can customize the AI model used for generating puns by setting these environment variables:

### Model configuration

- `PUNBOT_MODEL_NAME`: The name of the model to use (default: "gpt-4.1")
- `PUNBOT_API_BASE`: The API base URL (default: "https://api.openai.com/v1")

### Example configuration

```bash
export PUNBOT_MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o"
export PUNBOT_API_BASE="https://api.openai.com/v1"
```

Or set them programmatically:

```python
import os
os.environ["PUNBOT_MODEL_NAME"] = "gpt-4o"
os.environ["PUNBOT_API_BASE"] = "https://api.openai.com/v1"

import scipyconference as conf
conf.create_puns(5)
```

## What makes these puns special?

The puns are generated by an AI that understands the SciPy conference culture. They reference:

- Python libraries (NumPy, SciPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, PyMC)
- Scientific computing concepts (optimization, linear algebra, FFTs, simulations)
- Open-source software development practices
- Version control and CI/CD workflows
- Academic and research culture
- Conference life (poster sessions, lightning talks, coffee breaks)

The result? Puns that are nerdy, groan-worthy, and perfectly tailored to make SciPy attendees smile, chuckle, or roll their eyes appreciatively.

## Examples

Here are some typical outputs you might see:

```python
import scipyconference as conf

# Generate a single pun
conf.create_puns(1)
# Output: "Why don't NumPy arrays ever get lost? Because they always know their shape!"

# Generate with a specific topic
conf.create_puns(1, prompt="matplotlib visualization")
# Output: "I tried to plot my feelings, but matplotlib said 'figure' it out yourself!"
```

## Tips for best results

- **Be specific with prompts**: Instead of "Python", try "pandas dataframes" or "scipy optimization"
- **Conference context works well**: References to "poster sessions", "lightning talks", or "coffee breaks"
- **Mix topics**: Combine technical concepts with conference life for the best puns

Have fun punning at SciPy! ðŸŽ‰
